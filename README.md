# Netowrking-Assignment-2nd-Year----Basic-Timetabling-System
Created in a group of 3 in my second year.

Run by running the associated .bat files.
If this doesn't work (Maybe due to a lack of the JDK on your system), Run the following in the Linux Console or Windows CMD:

"java BordRailServer 22" for the server
"java BordRailClient localhost 22" for the client.

Note the server should be started first.
